# Bike-Share-PowerBI-project-Dashboard

### Dashboard Link : 

## Problem Statement:
To uncover valuable and unexpected hidden insights from the data, answering business questions and providing strategic recommendations.

### Process/steps followed:
Step 1 ; Firstly, I got this dataset from Kaggle and downloaded it.
Step 2 : Secondly, I extracted the file and named it Bike share data analysis on my computer and since it had a number of same files, I decided to then save everything I extracted into one folder so I can just combine the whole CSV file in power bi.
Step 3 : Thirdly, after saving the whole file in one folder, about 12 csv files I extracted, into one folder, I named it again as Bike share data set.
Step 4 : I then opened power Bi to start work. So I exported the whole folder containing the files from my desktop to power bi and then chose the combine and transform data option.
Step 5 : After choosing to combine all the files in the folder as one, I needed to do a little transforming before anything else in order to make my visualization work easy. So I first looked through my dataset and realized not all the information was going to be relevant so deleted these columns.(start station name, start station id, end station name, end station id, start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng)
Step 6 : I then proceeded to changing a few title names for my work. So I changed rideable_type to Ride/Bike type, and changed member_casual to rider.
Step 7 : I then checked for null values or blanks.
Step 8 : I again decided to split the started_at and ended_at column which contained the date and time of the activities. So I extracted the time values from the date values and ended up with some new columns. Mainly, start Date, End Date, Start Time and End Time.
Step 9 : From here, I needed to work out the duration per bike id so I just created a new column and worked out the durations there.
Step 10 : The next and final step was to create a new table as my calender date where I can work out the months and weekdays from that calender table. So I did that, and then since itâ€™s a new table I had to create a relationship with the main data table which is bike share data. So yhh.
